# IMPORTANT: Lab-0

For each lab assignment, **you must include and sign (by writing your name and student id number) the following Pledge of Honor statement at the beginning of your main method source code file. After including this statement, make sure that you do the commit and push operation on GitHub. Otherwise, your lab solution will not be graded.**
```
/* *********** Pledge of Honor ************************************************ *

# Lab 0

The objective of this Lab 0 is to make sure that you are able to clone the lab assignment template, and commit and push your solution to GitHub. You must follow the instructions provided on the course web site.

## Description:

*ASCII* (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes are used to represent characters in computers and telecom devices. 

ASCII is used for representing 128 English characters in the form of numbers, with each letter being assigned to a specific number in the range 0 to 127. For example, the ASCII code for uppercase A is 65, uppercase B is 66, and so on.

In Java, you can determine a characterâ€™s integer equivalent by preceding that character with (int), as in  (int) 'A'.  An operator of this form is called a cast operator. The following statement outputs a character and its integer equivalent:

```
System.out.printf("The character %c has the value %d%n", 'A', ((int) 'A'));
```

When the preceding statement executes, it displays the character A and the value 65 (from the Unicode character set). The format specifier %c is a placeholder for a character (in this case, the character 'A').

Inside the cloned Eclipse project, you will find a class named *Comp132*. In this class, write the necessary statements to complete the following task. 

## Task:

- Write the code for displaying the integer equivalents of your *\<name-surname-KUSIS-id\>*.
- Include characters *<*, *>*, and *-* .

## After you comple the task, do not forget to commit your changes and push them to your repository on Github.
